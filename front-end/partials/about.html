<h1>About us</h1>

<p>At Carboor Harvest we are passionate about bringing premium Australian hazelnuts to the discerning, quality seeking consumer.  
For too long, Australian consumers have been limited to finding fresh Australian hazelnuts at farmer’s markets, or accepting inferior Turkish nuts from previous seasons.  Flavoured nuts commonly contain more corn starch than actual nut.
Founded only in 2015, we are growing as a premium hazelnut producer and manufacturer – launching a range of premium flavoured nuts, oils and butters (hazelnut as well as almond and walnut).</p>
